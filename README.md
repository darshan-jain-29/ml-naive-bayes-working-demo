Successful implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithm - Machine Learning

Naive Bayes Algorithm can be used when you want to determine something based on past data/history. Following is an examples as per my understanding - If you want to differentiate between normal - useful emails and spam emails, you can use NB algorithm.

The entire code is commented for better understanding. 

Now, for using the above code implement the following 2 steps first

1. pip install scikit-learn
2. pip install nltk

After this run the command - 
python nb_author_id.py

This will print the results as follows -
no. of Chris training emails: 7936
no. of Sara training emails: 7884
training time: 1.724 s
Prediction time: 0.287 s
